## Node Server Installation for Ubuntu Users

We just have to use the `apt` package manager. 

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install nodejs

If the package in the repositories suits your needs, this is all that you need to do to get set up with Node.js. In most cases, you'll also want to also install npm, which is the Node.js package manager. You can do this by typing:

    sudo apt-get install npm
    
This will allow you to easily install modules and packages to use with Node.js.
